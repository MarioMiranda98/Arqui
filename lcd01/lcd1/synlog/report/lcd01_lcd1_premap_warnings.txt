@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: BN132 :"c:\users\farol\documents\arquitecturadecomputadoras3cm1\lcd01\lcdcontdata.vhdl":26:2:26:3|Removing sequential instance L03.outFlagcd because it is equivalent to instance L03.ENcd. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\farol\documents\arquitecturadecomputadoras3cm1\div00vhdl\div00.vhdl":20:3:20:4|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 24 sequential elements including L00.D01.sdiv[22:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
